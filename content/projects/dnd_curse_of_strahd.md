# What is Dungeons & Dragons: Curse Of Strahd?
It is a D&D tabletop RPG game, it is me and some long terms friends who roll some dice and act out various characters going through an adventure together.
We do stupid and silly stuff, drink a few beers and enjoy ourselves. We decided to record it and just share it with everyone interested. I know there's still a taboo and stigma that hangs around playing these types of games. But in honesty, it's just good nerdy fun. 

# What can you tell us about the game?
We play using the D&D 5e ruleset and are working our way through the Curse Of Strahd Campaign. It's a gothic horror setting, but we tend to make it our own.
Nothing much without giving a lot away. However, I always welcome ideas for the characters or story. Or if people wanted to join in for a session as a surprise guest, always welcome. Or would like for me to run a game for them (Time permitting)? I thoroughly enjoy running games for people.
There are currently 4 players who play a very colourful set of characters, Rez'han the lizardfolk druid/cleric, Arlo the halfling rogue, Kastimir the human monk and Bulk Kogan the half Orc Barbarian.
