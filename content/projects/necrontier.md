IN THE BEGINNING
During the Wars of Secession, this noble house defended the Dynasty's borders
Then came the C'TAN. The dynasty followed the Silent King's orders, but never truly embraced the C'Tan
After the betrayal, the Dynasty entered the GREAT SLEEP.
Something strange happened during the biotransference those millions of years ago. The Phaeron's body and mind have been switched with a lowly laborer.
The TOMB WORLD is now a desert world of rolling sands
The world had tribal people that are tolerated as the Dynasty's servantstribes that were enslaved to the Dynasty's will
The GREAT AWAKENING is complete, and the Lords scour the stars for other tomb worlds not awoken.
The EMINENT HERO of the awoken dynasty is a Necron Lord, Asmotek the Denied
When going to BATTLE, the dynasty raid with Doom Scythes and Night Shroud aircraft to soften their foes
The GREATEST ENEMY of the Dynasty is A chapter of Space Marines
The GOALS of of the Dynasty are amass a collection of riches and treasures unrivalled in existence AND the total domination of the galaxy; the subjugation or slaughter of the primitive races who dare to trespass upon their domain. The phaerons are utterly assured of their triumph, for their techology and martial strength have proven enough to enslave even the gods to their will.
