# What is Dungeon Delver?
Some time ago I was introduced to Godot by a colleague. Godot is an Open Source game engine with the built-in scripting language GDscript being very similar to Python. Over a weekend, I decided to download the engine and give it a go. I enjoyed how the engine structures components and how there is a friendly community surrounding it. It wasn't long before I had the idea of building a top-down action role-playing game. And so, Dungeon Delver was born. So, in short, it's me pottering about with the Godot game engine and my attempt at creating a game.

# What can you tell us about the game?
The goal of Dungeon Delver is to build a 2D action RPG. But focus more on doing boss fights over other more traditional RPG elements. The idea is to have the player move between rooms and fight various Boss Monsters, traps, puzzles, etc. these will have an arsenal of mechanics the player needs to handle to progress to the next room. After clearing all the rooms on a dungeon level, the player will advance deeper down to the next set of rooms.
The idea is to give each level of the dungeon a unique theme. Players will be able to buy gear, learn abilities and, level up their character.

# Where can I find the project?
I've put the code in an [open repository on Github](https://github.com/BlommaertsEdwin/DungeonDelver).
You can also find all the ideas and things I'm working on for Dungeon Delver on its [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/OYhKtffw/dungeon-delver-idea-board). I might eventually move everything over to Github to keep the project all in one place.
