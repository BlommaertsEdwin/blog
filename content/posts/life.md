Hello fucked up world! Today I'm celebrating my one week of being a Vegetarian. Technically, pescetarian. I've not touched a single piece of meat since the start of the week. It's been an interesting experience and it has been hard at times not to just give in. But hey, I've quit smoking, moved country, and pushed myself to a Uni degree while working in the past, so this is nothing, I don't fear challenges!

In other news, I was down with the sickness this weekend. My daughter is like a little petri dish and each day we send her to where there are more of these petri dishes and they gladly share their latest bacterial findings, and then, they bring it home, to share with their loving parents. You know those parents working jobs and sleeping maybe 6 hours a day. So, I met with Mister sledgehammer on Friday. Who reminded me (again) that I'm not 30 anymore, that kids don't have an off switch even when they're sick, that accumulating a sleep deficit WILL come back to haunt you and that life goes on!

Then there's the story of the Koala, the Panda, and the Muppet. A jealous insecure Muppet who thinks Koala and Panda can't be just friends. Luckily the Panda is smart and asks the Koala for some time, reminding the Koala that no matter near or far, there is always a place for a friend like him near the heart. Maybe one day the muppet will grow up and trust the Panda.
