Well, what a year this has been. My daughter turned six. I can't believe how fast she's growing. I can still vividly remember being able to hold her in one arm, the palm of my hand cradling her little head. Now she's putting on children's makeup and talking about boys that kissed her. I'm now also single. I didn't see that one coming at the start of the year, but here we are. We're still good friends and I share a lot with her. But we're better as friends, admittedly it took me a while to accept this. I felt alone in this period and was on an emotional rollercoaster. I thought I had lost everyone, and yet unexpected people came out of nowhere to lend me an ear or even advice.
