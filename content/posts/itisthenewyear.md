Welcome to the new year. Let's create a new list.

![The new year 2024](../../images/newyear.jpg)


- Keep running, and initially run more than I did last year. Looking at the stats on Strava that would mean running more than 292.3 km, which shouldn't be hard to do. If I succeed with that I'll try and go for 1000km for 2024. Write about my experience going through this journey. Last year's (2023) stats:
    - Activities 56
    - Distance 292.9 km
    - Time 37h 51m
    - Elev Gain	957 m
- Sign up to a Marathon and finish , I'll be happy with just finishing, not too worried about the time.
- Put some actual effort into my small game. I've been neglecting it in favor of playing games. Yes I'm looking at you Baldurs Gate III. Well at the very least have something playable by the end of the year.
- Get a car, I've been without one for long enough. Use it to travel to gigs, historical sites, cities around the UK. 
- Move into a new flat, decorate it and make it nice and comfortable for myself and my daughter.
- Giving this website a small overhaul.
- Continue writing my silly book based on the Solo RPG Irown Sworn.
- Go to many more gigs and concerts, have fun and write about the live experience. Just like I thoroughly enjoyed Decapitated. {{< youtube id="sMCn5AdASRE" >}}



That's it for now, I might add more but for now I'd like to achieve most of this list.

2023 you took my heart away, 2024 you'll bring the sun again.
