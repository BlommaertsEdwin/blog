Let's get the new year off to a good start with some personal goals:

- Get back into running, with the goal being, getting back to where I was two years ago. I want to run 5k in under 30 minutes and run 21k.
- I want to make progress on my game project EVERY DAY, as small or as big and, whatever it is, as long as it's something.
- Have a finished game by the end of the year, playable with a game loop, published, and asking feedback.
- Do not get caught in negative discussions with my autistic teenage son.
- Keep turning my office into my dream workspace.
- Make an active effort to write more blog posts, even if it's for myself.
- Actively think how I might sound talking to people, so I do not make them feel less.
Professional:

- Refine and work on the agile workflow process in Odoo and help roll out an agile development delivery process.
- Learn more about accounting, specifically with Odoo
- Learn the OWL javascript framework and become good at it. Write an app that uses owl, specifically, aimed at handheld devices.
- Do more TDD with Odoo, especially with complex process flows.

If I think of more, I might add them, but for now, that's it. If I can achieve a few of these things on this list, I will have had a good year.
