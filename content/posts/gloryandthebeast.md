**W**ith every step I took, the weight of my armour reminded me of the responsibility that rested upon my shoulders. I had been chosen to face the perils that lie ahead, to preserve the honor and prosperity of my kingdom.

The Battle Jacket, my faithful companion, bore the intricate symbols of my lineage. Passed down through generations, it signifies the strength and valor that courses through my veins. Embroidered with red, white, and black thread, the emblems of other noble bands gleamed in the fading light, a beacon of hope for all who witnessed its shining glory.

I mounted the metal carriage, and with a thunderous roar, we charged towards the battleground of musical marvels cutting through the old city of Londinium. Tonight, beneath the starry sky, three bands shall engage in an epic clash of sound, each with their own unique tale to unfold.

With a fierce determination in my eyes, I joined the **ENDLESS** ranks of fellow warriors and set off on a long march towards the grand arena where three legendary bands would ignite the O2 forum battlegrounds with their melodic fury. The column winded its way all through the narrow streets. I saw many other battle jackets, Unicorns adorned with Battle Barding, and faces painted in battle colours. 

![Brothers of Metal stage performance](../../images/brothers.jpg)

[**Brothers Of Metal**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0WPCPYm5IDNtQjuJOGNPcy?si=J-nLCqoJRc69eZxdfcNngA) 

First amongst them were the Brothers of Metal, a fearsome band of Viking warriors dedicated to Thor, Yggdrasil, and Valhalla. The thunderous sound of their battle hymns resonated within me, these invoked the spirit of my ancestors and filled me with indomitable strength. I passed the potion dispenser's tent and took up my defensive stance on the left atop a hill. Above me, more warriors took to the skies held aloft by the many spells of balcony. There was also an orderly battle line formed for the purchase of the Merch armour. Sadly I was badly positioned on the battlefield when the Brothers let rip their onslaught. The sounds and hymns sounded muffled but the beats quite literally made the ground shudder beneath me. First they told us about the [**fall of the god of light**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1OnHeldjfrF6Zx3FnS1zQ5?si=45a20fca8a21492f) which led into the [**Prophecy of Ragnarök**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4kpWVGdFjBSoCkIcHVlTqn?si=8fb2269e9f744871) warriors around me raised their fists towards the sky as the Brothers hailed for the Warriors Of Valhalla. Soon they called for [**Njord**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4LaAvSHoSmuTWq3RiD0pOY?si=153f38759efd4a02) God of the Wind and Seas as more Viking warriors entered the battleground on Longships. As I glanced over my shoulder at the battlefield it was filling up nicely. I felt my chest swell standing there, shoulder to shoulder with my battle brothers and sisters. As I turned my gaze forward, the sky was lit afire, and through the clouds I saw winged horses, wolves, and boars carrying maidens with spears descend and carry back up the slain Viking warriors, the Brothers hailed this wonderous event as the [**Ride of the Valkyries**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1npDycvcBm6bTnaajiTv3X?si=3d900c446940400f) The silence that fell after this song was quieting the battlefield, the sky dimmed and many a Mobile Torch was lit and you could see them flickering and swaying as the air was filled with magic and melodic tones introducing the [**Concerning Norns**](https://open.spotify.com/track/5WhNrwy16pS3xYKDxVpTGc?si=ae4064f22c7d4d96) through which they let the warriors know to accept their fate and the power of Faith. Which then led into [**Yggdrasil**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3V417nSM4Ilh0Tt5CqustV?si=f758feb0a45c4579) which was sung aloud by all on the battlefield. Thunder and lightning struck the battlefield as the brothers burst into the the [**Defenders of Valhalla**](https://open.spotify.com/track/37oLbcJ5oouA1PJJsKOjub?si=494b1b3022934dc2) this united the warriors on the battlefield once more after suffering countless casualties to the forces of Mundane existence and Modern Society and Culture. But nothing prepared me for what happened next. The battlefield was divided into three divisions, each one championing a specific element of the next song. I was brought under the Steel section and each time the chorus of the song [**Fire Blood and Steel**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1KuNk1ZZPTZKwjjo1Vdw9G?si=10ba436791124a91) was sung by the Brothers, each Division would loudly respond by belting out their division's name. FIRE! BLOOD! STEEL!
FIRE! BLOOD! STEEL! and on it went. It was EPIC! Then there was just [**ONE**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1V8Kp81sYUxX2xfFhp2gck?si=2c87a5a045c04866) last song before the Brothers had to retreat. As they left the battlefield I felt impressed by the female vocalist and how much energy and fun was had by the band. And that even though this band was seen as a support troupe they surely were equals.

[**Beast In Black**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rEuaTPLMhlViNCJrg3NEH?si=dJWArL7oRhGiE_L85hBfDg)

Next we were transported through the unforgiving fabric of time by none other than Beast in Black. Like whispers from a dystopian future, their music resonated with the echoes of a cybernetic realm. In Blade Runner fashion, their soaring melodies entwined with pulsating synths charged the air with electric energy. With every beat, I was propelled through neon-lit landscapes, my sword arm yearning for battle.

As the turmoil of the time travel had ended, we were greeted by [**Shock to the system**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3WABwzdfznRv90Tai7P1in?si=f838c93736784eb0) and landed in a neon-lit Japanese-inspired metropolis. Thirsty from the previous battle I quickly ran to a Sakaya (酒屋) and purchased some well-needed alcoholic beverages. This time I re-positioned to the center of the battlefield still some distance away from the front lines. I laughed, I had heard this same song before, with Lord Of The Lost.

One by one the band members arrived on the stage, the drummer and drumset positioned high upon a raised platform. Slowly synth notes drifted over the now futuristic battlefield, complete with Japanese gates at either side. The notes slowly gaining volume were that of [**Bladerunner**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0HlhtIdbSWSKW9DU5sXeFX?si=9734e121050843f4) and with that, the scene was set. It was a rapid succession of songs, an assault of Power Metal. Perhaps a touch of cheesy charm, a hint of unapologetic romanticism, but none of it mattered. We were warriors united, consumed by the music's fiery spirit. Our voices merged seamlessly with the band, becoming a single entity, pulsating with pure exhilaration. First was [**Bella Donna**](https://open.spotify.com/track/2RBmZvz4VWQdUrgGPBmzjL?si=2669c0f5914c4259) followed by [**Beast in Black**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ngSk8aGEjWS6fsHIV9KKj?si=364f723c38b44c88) Leading into, [**Sweet True Lies**](https://open.spotify.com/track/2cyJkqB2OYHwWWvKGtrJ0r?si=a3d11d10ef27459c) It was at this time I noticed the drummers infectious joy, his radiant smile never wavered while he was smashing away on those drums. Unleashing a display of harmonic power, the three guitar players skillfully propelled their Axes through the air in perfect unison. We serenaded the [**Broken Survivors**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4OjnXqAIPrLwfZpcHqhyzw?si=938b0c89aedf4a03) and then we went back to where it all began [**From Hell With Love**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3iKSyNDGzJ3FcjXoDKqehS?si=6356710064884a8e). Then the thunderous drums of [**Hardcore**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kKzLv3w7I5NXzEtWkSzi4?si=fd67f48fea074256) started playing, compelling every soul in the room to thrust their hands skyward, shouting "HARDCORE!" in unison. After this fierce assault receded, we embraced a moment of tenderness with the delicate harmony of [**Moonlight rendez vous**](https://open.spotify.com/track/6P5Ma1HFYDsgOpLaGu6Jkz?si=8eb0896469f54ecd).

However, this electrifying calm didn't stand a chance! With a sudden burst of rapid beats, the mosh pit exploded to the exhilarating sounds of [**Zodd The Immortal**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rW7HpxbunvRKn4rql3Kni?si=28099ea799e7433a)! But just when we thought the adrenaline rush was starting over again, the battlefield transformed into a serene oasis as [**Ghost in the Rain**](https://open.spotify.com/track/7L9vDIDuqRUJRFxI2RBK2T?si=b387ae20bc9b4e80) graced our ears. It took me by surprise because, let me tell you, Beast in Black songs aren't typically known for their slower, medley-like vibes. Yet, this one touched my soul in the most unexpected but pleasurable way.

![Beast in black guitar player](https://cdn.recordcollectormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_2348a-768x513.jpg)

But hold on tight, because the excitement was about to skyrocket! The pulsating energy of [**Highway To Mars**](https://open.spotify.com/track/2uoiILxQMf5BRSTivExIgV?si=05c0a5bddce64a3a) transported us into the vast expanse of the cosmos, leaving behind everything and surrendering to the winds of change. And then it happened – my heart skipped a beat as [**Blind and Frozen**](https://open.spotify.com/track/7iOSeHfKU2EhSKcX7TbjKG?si=61df4089e03e4498) the song near and dear to my heart, began to play. In a surge of pure ecstasy, I hoisted my drink cup high and belted out the lyrics with all my might. The entire battlefield ignited into a colossal mosh pit, stretching as far as the eye could see. It was an awe-inspiring sight, and I couldn't contain my joy at the realization that others shared my love for this masterpiece. So, without hesitation, I happily joined the psychedelic chaos, bouncing and thrashing as the music moved through every fiber of my being. The energy stayed sky-high as we seamlessly transitioned into [**Die By The Blade**](https://open.spotify.com/track/53h1ZSLWi8hVWF9DWKNXVh?si=5715968af9b447db), and the sky itself seemed to burst into a mesmerizing display of stardust during [**One Night In Tokyo**](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TZtQt10Ajm3wB4MoqluZj?si=192eff4973b34f40). A surge of melancholy washed over me, knowing that the crowd's fervor reached its peak during Blind and Frozen. But alas, all good things must come to an end, and so did this euphoric journey with the final anthem of the evening, [**End Of The World**](https://open.spotify.com/track/6LtjVoJQ1uTk69wxWuCYHy?si=b10f91fd60a84f9a). It felt as if the world was coming to a close along with the song, leaving us craving for more. But fear not, for the memories and emotions evoked by this magical night will stay with us forever and, ... they did say they would be back, soon tm.

![Gloryhammer opening stage performance](../../images/tomjonesgloryhammer.jpg)

[**Gloryhammer**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7dkEByOe0oHqc54qU4hwzV?si=Se53L4jGQHiSWftctpJD9Q)

Silence...darkness...cold winds from the frozen north (air conditioning)...sudden but distant quiet tones of [**Mighty Wings**](https://open.spotify.com/track/7LGcQjyaSSd81RSBBLCIPM?si=2f5a6217bc514097)...lasers...swords...hammers. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness I could see the silhouette of a castle rising in the distance. The Japanese gates transformed into brick-and-mortar walls. Towers appeared on either side of the battlefield. Again I repositioned myself, slightly more centered still. Slowly green moonlight lit the castle and a figure appeared atop the castle tower. Could it be? Yes, it was the immortal wizard Tomee Johnes. Suddenly [**'clang clang clang clang clang clang, I saw the light on the night I passed by her window'**](https://open.spotify.com/track/2v8B8d17Xxu9uLU5sNiHSL?si=d147008b433d4547) and again in one voice the entire battlefield sang "MY MY MY DELILAH", "WHY WHY WHY DELILAH", while the moonlight turned to blue and purple. A loud ruckus erupted from my fellow warriors as Tomee Johnes left the tower and dark ominous music blasted over the battlefield, one by one the band members entered the castle. From all over warriors were shouting "Hoots Hoots Hoots Hoots" The atmosphere was genuinely charged with the power of anticipation. Immediately we were greeted by the [**Holy Flamming Hammer of Unholly Cosmic Frost**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0C9zjzK1ZCHL5Cid66Izxr?si=a0922bf9e0944070) as mighty heroes from the mighty highlands to the shores of Auchtertool a shining realm of Unicorn defenders. Charging forward into the moshpit we went, bouncing in unison with other heroes as we raced in circles around the pit, hands aloft. This song was straight on followed by [**Goryhammer**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4vyrKBuBfgv390ItIC75Sw?si=b5b0bcfc858e458c)! Which still holds the silliest lyrics ever. "Galaxies swarming behind me. Nebulas lying ahead. This can only mean that I have arrived in space, oh yeah!" But still, we chanted "Glory Hammer!", "Laser Powered Goblin Smasher!", "Glory Hammer!", "Thunder Striking Wizard Striker!", "Glory Hammer!", "Heavy Metal Darklord Crasher", "Glory Hammer!". From what seemed everywhere we felt the ground shake before we even heard the sound of a thousand thunderous hooves smashing the ground and we were on our way to [**The Land of Unicorns**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0T4TXWBw0QM5l8dwzpn0Wx?si=6a9c0abf76794bca) as we charged ahead and reached these lands it wasn't long before we came across these magnificent beasts and the sight of such splendor made myself and others want to [**Fly away**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0KRMfSzkY5G4ORX2jJDX9E?si=d7b70ff0a91147fd) into the stars of the eternal galaxy to discover the force inside of us. But it was the sight of [Angus Mcfife](https://open.spotify.com/track/1jSQRvpQYPcIKt67fc5Npv?si=3a7159b605674122) the prince of the land of fife, charging across the wastelands that made us change our hearts. We would not forget our quest to defend the lands of Fife and thus we returned to the battlefield.

![Hootsman and ser Proletius drinking](https://cdn.recordcollectormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_2733a.jpg)

There in a clearing in the center of the field of battle were the Hoots Man (Bass player) and Ser Proletius (Guitar player) both holding mighty warhorn cups filled to the brim with beer which they slowly raised to their chin and then proceeded to gulp down with much fervor to the sound of [**Also Sprach Zarathursta**](https://open.spotify.com/track/43YwOmGUOS3zzGvj1Feszb?si=a88538e090b349b2) As they finished their mighty drinks, and the music died down, the Hoots spoke to his fellow warriors and welcomed them back, casually pointing out the castle they had brought along and how good it felt to be on this battlefield with his fellow heroes. From behind us, we could hear loud engines roaring, it was the [**Wasteland Warrior Hoots Patrol**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0LsTetwB4A3UxsGi2btUWm?si=e6351846a10c49ab) on nuclear-powered motorbikes clad in leather boots and thermo-nuclear gear they rode through the ice and snow greeting their leader the Hootsman their only law is the law of hoots. The Hootsman joined the patrol and signaled all on the battlefield to follow. With our spirits risen, we joined in their charge across a nuclear wasteland, and with our quest for [**Fife Eternal**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0LdPmDgOXnMLQZALBZt9D3?si=b9b8515d21174077) we rushed ahead. Angus Mcfife joined the head of the stampede and informed us that an evil force had risen to the East. So we rode, we rode as hard as we could, for we, we were about to face the [**Masters of the Glaxy**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4eOk7ZtVdc3Ri433gEEvij?si=056ca0871b32449a), Lords of Space Dundee, the destroyers of reality, on a quest for all eternity. They once fought for the light and the king but have now fallen to the evil powers of Zargothrax.
And so we entered [**The siege of Dunkeld**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3ak9dgaPyd4kj7pNsmX5Wy?si=4486717a923a4592) and it is here we face the source of all evil, the [**Keeper of the celestial Flame of Abernathy**](https://open.spotify.com/track/7xTjCWrYgCXNvXw6V4iGdy?si=d750b19f5d3d45e9), Zargothrax, the master of nightmares. A simple peasant once, weaving baskets, but after a prince destroyed his home he joined with evil chaos forces and vowed revenge. Dashing ahead of the army Angus Mcfife proclaims he wants to set the [**Universe on Fire**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3e77C0bCaFIUXNFxI075D9?si=65cd6128b4954bd8) filled with such conviction and belief that we will vanquish the evil forces, his faith undenieable. However, we soon realised we were on the losing end of the battle, as the forces of evil pressed their attack and our forces dwindled. We were forced to retreat! If it had not been for the [**Hootsforce**](https://open.spotify.com/track/5gJ1DNzFHwNFlEw1UltyFk?si=0da65a16ab7c4884), a fleet of space-faring atomic submarines using nuclear weapons, we might have been wiped out. Sadly all but one were destroyed. But, we were able to escape with our lives.

![Undead Unicorn](../../images/unicorninvasion.png)

And thus the evil Zargothrax rode at the head of an army of undead Unicorns into the city of Dundee and it was called [**The Unicorn Invasion**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Lmu3dtUQo2etxILOEtRrH?si=e79e785de9204af7) As we hung our heads in defeat, slumped to our knees, and dropped our weapons on the blood-soaked earth (Well it was certainly something sticky that was causing me shoes to stick the floor. I swear if I didn't move on a regular basis I would have lost my shoes. Some spilled sugary drink no doubt.) it was the Hootsman who sacrificed himself by detonating his neutron star heart in a Neutronic Transnova explosion destroying the entire planet and ripping a hole in space-time sucking everyone to an alternate timeline. It all happened in a flash. When I opened my eyes the skies had opened up and the entire battlefield bathed in golden sun-light (Stage lights came on) Under the loud hailing of "Hoots Hoots Hoots" by every warrior around I saw the Hootsman being crowned King Hootsman of Unst.
> My warriors, we have gathered here today to celebrate a
> Momentous occasion in history. By the power vested in me
> By all the gods of Dundee, I crown thee King Hootsman of Unst!
