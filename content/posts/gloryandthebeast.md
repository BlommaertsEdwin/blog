**W**ith every step I took, the weight of my armour reminded me of the responsibility that rested upon my shoulders. I had been chosen to face the perils that lie ahead, to preserve the honor and prosperity of my kingdom.

The Battle Jacket, my faithful companion, bore the intricate symbols of my lineage. Passed down through generations, it signifies the strength and valor that courses through my veins. Embroidered with red, white, and black thread, the emblems of other noble bands gleamed in the fading light, a beacon of hope for all who witnessed its shining glory.

I mounted the metal carriage, and with a thunderous roar, we charged towards the battleground of musical marvels cutting through the old city of Londinium. Tonight, beneath the starry sky, three bands shall engage in an epic clash of sound, each with their own unique tale to unfold.

With a fierce determination in my eyes, I joined the **ENDLESS** ranks of fellow warriors and set off on a long march towards the grand arena where three legendary bands would ignite the O2 forum battlegrounds with their melodic fury. The column winded its way all through the narrow streets. I saw many other battle jackets, Unicorns adorned with Battle Barding, and faces painted in battle colours.

[**Brothers Of Metal**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0WPCPYm5IDNtQjuJOGNPcy?si=J-nLCqoJRc69eZxdfcNngA) 

First amongst them were the Brothers of Metal, a fearsome band of Viking warriors dedicated to Thor, Yggdrasil, and Valhalla. The thunderous sound of their battle hymns resonated within me, these invoked the spirit of my ancestors and filled me with indomitable strength. I passed the potion dispenser's tent and took up my defensive stance on the left atop a hill. Above me, more warriors took to the skies held aloft by the many spells of balcony. There was also an orderly battle line formed for the purchase of the Merch armour. Sadly I was badly positioned on the battlefield when the Brothers let rip their onslaught. The sounds and hymns sounded muffled but the beats quite literally made the ground shudder beneath me. First they told us about the [**fall of the god of light**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1OnHeldjfrF6Zx3FnS1zQ5?si=45a20fca8a21492f) which led into the [**Prophecy of Ragnarök**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4kpWVGdFjBSoCkIcHVlTqn?si=8fb2269e9f744871) warriors around me raised their fists towards the sky as the Brothers hailed for the Warriors Of Valhalla. Soon they called for [**Njord**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4LaAvSHoSmuTWq3RiD0pOY?si=153f38759efd4a02) God of the Wind and Seas as more Viking warriors entered the battleground on Longships. As I glanced over my shoulder at the battlefield it was filling up nicely. I felt my chest swell standing there, shoulder to shoulder with my battle brothers and sisters. As I turned my gaze forward, the sky was lit afire, and through the clouds I saw winged horses, wolves, and boars carrying maidens with spears descend and carry back up the slain Viking warriors, the Brothers hailed this wonderous event as the [**Ride of the Valkyries**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1npDycvcBm6bTnaajiTv3X?si=3d900c446940400f) The silence that fell after this song was quieting the battlefield, the sky dimmed and many a Mobile Torch was lit and you could see them flickering and swaying as the air was filled with magic and melodic tones introducing the [**Concerning Norns**](https://open.spotify.com/track/5WhNrwy16pS3xYKDxVpTGc?si=ae4064f22c7d4d96) through which they let the warriors know to accept their fate and the power of Faith. Which then led into [**Yggdrasil**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3V417nSM4Ilh0Tt5CqustV?si=f758feb0a45c4579) which was sung aloud by all on the battlefield. Thunder and lightning struck the battlefield as the brothers burst into the the [**Defenders of Valhalla**](https://open.spotify.com/track/37oLbcJ5oouA1PJJsKOjub?si=494b1b3022934dc2) this united the warriors on the battlefield once more after suffering countless casualties to the forces of Mundane existence and Modern Society and Culture. But nothing prepared me for what happened next. The battlefield was divided into three divisions, each one championing a specific element of the next song. I was brought under the Steel section and each time the chorus of the song [**Fire Blood and Steel**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1KuNk1ZZPTZKwjjo1Vdw9G?si=10ba436791124a91) was sung by the Brothers, each Division would loudly respond by belting out their division's name. FIRE! BLOOD! STEEL!
FIRE! BLOOD! STEEL! and on it went. It was EPIC! Then there was just [**ONE**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1V8Kp81sYUxX2xfFhp2gck?si=2c87a5a045c04866) last song before the Brothers had to retreat. As they left the battlefield I felt impressed by the female vocalist and how much energy and fun was had by the band. And that even though this band was seen as a support troupe they surely were equals.

[**Beast In Black**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rEuaTPLMhlViNCJrg3NEH?si=dJWArL7oRhGiE_L85hBfDg)

Next we were transported through the unforgiving fabric of time by none other than Beast in Black. Like whispers from a dystopian future, their music resonated with the echoes of a cybernetic realm. In Blade Runner fashion, their soaring melodies entwined with pulsating synths charged the air with electric energy. With every beat, I was propelled through neon-lit landscapes, my sword arm yearning for battle.

As the turmoil of the time travel had ended, we were greeted by [**Shock to the system**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3WABwzdfznRv90Tai7P1in?si=f838c93736784eb0) and landed in a neon-lit Japanese-inspired metropolis. Thirsty from the previous battle I quickly ran to a Sakaya (酒屋) and purchased some well-needed alcoholic beverages. This time I re-positioned to the center of the battlefield still some distance away from the front lines.
