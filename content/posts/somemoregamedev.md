Right, made some more progress with the animation tree and hooking that into the state machine. I would also need a place to store ideas and tasks I need to work on. I've got the character in a decent state but there are a few improvements I would like to add, but don't want to deal with that just yet. So some sort of list would be nice.

I had to register if the right mouse button was held down as a separate variable. That way I could switch back to moving when I held down the button but moved the cursor away. I'm not sure this is the best way but it works for now.

Time to key in the attack action frames.
