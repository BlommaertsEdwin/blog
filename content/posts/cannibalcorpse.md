**S**uch an epic evening. First we trash out to Municipal Waste and then we dive into Cannibal Corpse. To end the vening with an adventure with three other metal heads who couldn't get to Stratford because of closed lines. Five busses and a car journey later we got home, otherwise it would have been an expensive cab journey home or a long wait for the train. Thanks again boys, you saved the night and it was epic getting to know you. Josh and Brandon but I can't remember the name of the third guy! Sorry, if you ever read this brother!

Thanks for introducing me to Venom and Cancer Bats. I regret not having gotten your number, would have been cool to do you a solid in return.

Also call out to Gandalf the wizard on one of the busses with his wooden staff. Thank you for your wise words in leading us four Hobbits.

But how was Cannibal Corpse?

Well It was the first time seeing them

Municipal waste was also on point, a big party and lots of silly fun. Wave of death with lots of crowd surfers.
