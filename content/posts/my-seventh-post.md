Using my partner's Wacom Bamboo drawing pad, I went to work creating some bushes and a palisade, also known as a stake wall. At first, I used GIMP, and would make a drawing and then convert it to pixel art. That did not work well as the Jpeg came out all blurred. I then decided to use a program I had purchased a long time ago called Aseprite. After watching a few Youtube videos and picking up some hints and tips. I switched to drawing pixel art directly and, I am pretty happy with how it turned out. I'm not a talented artist. But, I did enjoy drawing my art and now putting it into my game. I can see how I can get better by iterating over a drawing if I'm not happy with it. 

So our naked little man can now do more pervy things behind a palisade and a bush. Check out the video below.
