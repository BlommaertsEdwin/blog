![White and red striped popcorn bag with popcorn flying about.](../../images/poppedecorn.jpg)

Today I introduced my daughter to the popcorn song!
We both danced, we put it on repeat, slammed a bag of popcorn in the microwave,
 and danced some more. She's now eaten a small bowl of popcorn.

I love my life and my daughter.

I ended it with a METAL VERSION!!!!! \m/
