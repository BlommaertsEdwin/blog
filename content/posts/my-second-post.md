I thoroughly enjoyed gaming with my friends today. Even though I was pretty tired and had a head full of worries, just hearing them laugh and enjoy the game I was running for them cheered me up. The only thing missing to improve the atmosphere was some music and sound effects. I plan to add this to the next session by using a discord bot and Syrinscape. Additionally, I have a few ideas that I would like to try out in terms of the story. They are just breadcrumbs or hooks which set the players up for a bigger adventure, but they promise to be interesting and, I can not wait to hear how the players will react. All in all, it was an enjoyable night.
