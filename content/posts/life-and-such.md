Hello again fucked up world! This time I'm writing a positive message. I don't know who will read this, and I don't care. But the power of staying positive and not drowning yourself in sadness or self-pity is amazing. Just recently I was blown away by a series of positive events that all happened on the same day. I won't go into details but at the end of the day, everything fell into place. It was such an amazing feeling!

So I've decided to continue charging forward with this happy positive attitude! There is no ceiling, only the one you put there for yourself. Don't get me wrong, it's not easy staying positive, you will stumble, fall, trip, and smash into concrete, but in the end, get up, dust yourself off, and change your mindset to a positive one.

I've met some amazing people along my journey so far. They're all so different and special in their way. I sometimes fall into the trap to try and please them, adjusting myself to get them to like me. That's just fucked up and I need to knock that off. I need to go my own way, I am who I am, take it or leave it!
